		   QUARRY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Untar the sources, `cd' to the directory where you unpacked Quarry and
invoke `configure' script:

	./configure [OPTIONS]

If your system is sane, the only reason for `configure' to complain is
absence of GTK+ 2.x library.  If this is the case, download the
library from

	http://gtk.org/download/

Note that GTK+ 1.x won't work and will never be supported in Quarry.
GTK+ 2.x is so much better that there is no reason to support older
versions.

Now invoke the `make' program:

	make

If it succeeded then you are done.  You should now have a binary named
`quarry' residing in the `src' directory.  You can find a bit
information on what you can do with it in file README.  No proper
documentation is available yet, sorry.

If something went wrong, please have a look at the next section.

After this, you should install Quarry by typing

	make install

(you may need to login as super-user first).  After this, everything
should be set up just fine.

Note that Quarry binary can be placed anywhere.  This means that you
can run the copy in your build directory as well the installed one.
Also, if you rebuild Quarry, you don't need to reinstall it unless
files in `data/' subdirectory has changed or you intend to run the
installed binary, not the one in build directory.


			INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If Quarry won't configure or compile on your system and you are sure
that you have GTK+ 2.x, I would certainly like to fix that.  See file
named README for details on how to report bugs.  Remember that the
more information you provide, the more likely I will fix the problem.

Before sending a bug report, please make sure that GTK+ 2.x is
installed: type

	pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0

If the library is installed, it will print the exact version.  If it
is not, `pkg-config' will tell you that or fail to run at all.  Don't
forget to include GTK+ version in your bug report.
