				QUARRY

Quarry is a universal board game interface program.  At present it
supports three games: Go, Amazons and Othello.  It is intended to be
useful for both users and developers of game engines (i.e. programs
that play board games).

Currently, Quarry is in very early stages of development.  It is not
really useful yet.  However, you are most welcome to have a try with
it.  I'm sure you will like at least the way it looks.


			     INSTALLATION

The usual `./configure; make' should build Quarry.  The only serious
requirement for Quarry is GTK+ 2.x library, everything else must be
present on a sane system.  See file INSTALL for details.


			    RUNNING QUARRY

In the absence of proper documentation, here are a few words about
what you can do with Quarry.

Playing games should be rather straightforward.  If you want to play
against a computer (or watch computer playing itself) you will need a
program that supports GTP.  So far I know only about Go programs that
are freely available and support GTP and the best of them is probably
GNU Go.  You can get it from

	http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html

You will need to "register" whatever GTP engine (program) you have in
Quarry.  Just click "Preferences" button in the Control Center.
Alternatively, when starting a new game, you can click on "Manage
Engine List" button.  Once you have registered the engine(s), just
select them as white and/or black player in the new game dialog.

To play a move, simply left-click your mouse on the board.  For
Amazons a move requires 3 clicks (select a queen, point where to move
it and point where to shoot arrow to). Note, that as you move mouse
pointer over the board, a semi-transparent "ghost" shows up or
disappears thus providing a hint whether a move is legal or not.

So far, Quarry treats all command line parameters as names of SGF
files to open.  You can run it either without any parameters at all,
or supply one or more files to start with.

When you open an SGF file, either with a GTK+ file selector or from
command line, you will see a nice-looking board.  You can use cursor
keys for navigating through the files.

Right and Left go forward and backward in the game record (i.e. they
play and undo moves--actually SGF nodes--from it on board).  Instead
of browsing move at a time, you can use Page Down and Page Up to skip
ten moves at once.  Home and End go to the very beginning or the very
end of game record.

Down and Up switch to next or previous variation of the current move
(node), if any.  Variations can be thought of as alternative ways the
game can continue.  If there are variations containing moves, you will
see them as small semi-transparent stones (or queens, or pieces
depending on the game) on the board.  You can right-click on such a
"ghost" to switch to variation at its position.  It can be more
convenient than Down/Up when there are lots of variations all over the
board.

If keyboard focus slips from board to another control, you can use the
keys mentioned above with Alt modifier, e.g. Alt-Right or Alt-Home.


			    REPORTING BUGS

Please use bug tracker at the Gna! project page for bug submissions.
Point your browser to

	https://gna.org/bugs/?group=quarry

Before submitting a bug, please update to latest CVS version of Quarry
and verify that the bug is still present.  Don't forget to check if
the bug has been submitted already.

Please include the following information in your bug report:

* Bug description and the way to reproduce the bug.

* Output of Quarry in the terminal, if any.  It would typically die
  with a message like this:

	quarry: file-name.c:123: some_function_name: Assertion `...'
	failed.

* If you fail to configure or build Quarry in the first place, please
  send in several last lines of `configure's and/or `make's output,
  depending on where the problem occurred.

* System information, including version of GTK+.  You can find it by
  typing

	pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0

  in command line.  Remember that only GTK+ 2.0 or later is supported.
  If you have an older version, Quarry will fail to configure and it
  is not a bug.

* Everything else you find relevant.

    On the site there is a disclaimer with the following text:

	"Disclaimer: Background textures found on this site were not

    And in its "Terms of use" section, it is stated that

    I'm very interested in a good texture that is either cleanly
    licensed in a non-restrictive way that allows redistribution and
    modification or is in public domain.  If you happen to have/know
    about such a texture that would fit Quarry's look, please send it
    or a link to it to <quarry-dev@gna.org>.
