	* configure.ac: Quarry version 0.1.2.

	* configure.ac: New option `--disable-sgf-utils'.

	* configure.ac: Convert `dnl' comments to `#' comments as
	suggested by Autoconf manual.

2004-04-14  Paul Pogonyshev  <pogonyshev@gmx.net>

	* configure.ac: Add `AM_MAINTAINER_MODE' so that `Makefile's don't
	try to run Autoconf and/or Automake by default.

2004-04-13  Paul Pogonyshev  <pogonyshev@gmx.net>

	* configure.ac: Remove `QUARRY_WARNINGS_REDUCED' variable, because
	`-Wwrite-strings' gives warnings on too many pieces of GTK+ code
	and it's not worth it to use the flag for some files and not the
	others.


Changes before the project registration on Gna! (2004-04-12) were not logged.
