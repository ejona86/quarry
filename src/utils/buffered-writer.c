/* This module provides a buffered file writer with a few useful
 * features:
 *
 * - Allows on-the-fly re-encoding of incoming text.  Moreover,
 *   required encoding can change arbitrary between writes to the
 *   buffer (use buffered_writer_set_iconv_handle() macro to change
 *   it).  Incoming text must be in UTF-8.
 *
 * - Tracks current column in the output stream, thus making output
 *   formatting easier for higher level code.
