/* Memory pools are used for storing large numbers of small items of
 * same size (e.g. SGF nodes and properties).  They store the items in
 * chunks, each consisting of NUM_ITEMS_IN_CHUNK items.
 *
 * The advantages are:
 *
 * - way less calls to malloc() and free() (faster memory management);
 *
 * - smaller memory footprint (the smaller the items, the better);
 *
 * - fast traversing of all allocated items (in no particular order,
 *   though; the callback must not make any assumptions);
 *
 * - very fast "flushing" of pools which frees all items stored.
 *
 * The disadvantage is that all items must include a field of
 * `ItemIndex' type (unsigned char) as their first field.
 *
 *
 * Chunks in memory pools are kept in double-linked list.  Non-full
 * chunks (with at least one free item) are kept together in the
 * list's head.  At least one non-full chunk must always be present.
 *
 * Each item's first field must be of `ItemIndex' type.  This field is
 * private to memory pool and must not be used from outside.
 *
 * When an item is allocated, this field contains item's index in
 * chunk and is used in memory_pool_free() for finding chunk structure
 * in memory.  When an item is free, the field contains index of
 * chunk's next free item.
 *
 * Knowing the above, it is possible to say if an item in chunk is
 * free (provided that you have a pointer to chunk).  This fact is
 * used in item traversing.
