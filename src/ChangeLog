	* sgf/sgf-writer.c (do_write_point_or_rectangle): Fix typo ('['
	instead of ']') that caused severe SGF file corruptions.

	* gui-gtk/gtk-goban-window.c: Add basic support for SGF file
	saving.  Note: quite dangerous now, because it never checks or
	asks anything, just writes.
	(gtk_goban_window_save)
	(save_file_as_response, save_file_as_destroy): New functions.

	* gui-gtk/gtk-goban-window.c (gtk_goban_window_init): Add menu bar
	to window (with just few items for now).

	* gui-gtk/Makefile.am: Remove custom build rules for
	`quarry-stock.o', because `QUARRY_WARNINGS_GTK' does not contain
	`-Wwrite-strings' (which is problematic for this file) anymore.


Changes before the project registration on Gna! (2004-04-12) were not logged.
