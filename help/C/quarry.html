      The Quarry application enables you to play the board games of Go, Amazons and
      Othello.  You can play with computer programs or with another human, and save, view
      and edit game records.
    </p><p>
      Quarry provides the following features:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	  Nice resizeable board.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Support for
	  <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/" target="_top">GTP</a>
	  (Game Text Protocol) as an interface to game-playing programs.  In particular,
	  you can play with
	  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html" target="_top">GNU Go</a>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Game records are stored in widely supported
	  <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/" target="_top">SGF</a> FF[4] file
	  format.  Quarry has an extremely fast SGF parser, which is important if you have
	  very large SGF files.
	</p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	Quarry itself can play neither Go, nor Amazons, nor Othello.  To have a computer
	opponent, you need to find a program (i.e. GNU Go mentioned above) that supports
	GTP and <a href="#register-game-playing-program" title="To Register a Game-Playing Program">register it in Quarry</a>.

      </p><p>
	<b>quarry</b> <i><tt>file1.sgf file2.sgf ...</tt></i>
      </p><p>

	<a href="#when-start" title="When You Start Quarry">Control Center window</a>.  The
	<a href="#new-game-dialog" title="New Game Dialog">New Game dialog</a> will appear, where you can

	    Click the Open Game Record button in the
	    <a href="#when-start" title="When You Start Quarry">Control Center window</a>.  Quarry will display

	  </p></li><li><p>
	    When starting Quarry, specify the name of file (or several names at once) at
	    the command line:
	  </p><p>
	    <b>quarry</b> <i><tt>file1.sgf file2.sgf ...</tt></i>

	To save a game record, choose
	File-&gt;Save
	menu item in its <a href="#board-windows" title="Board Windows">Board window</a> (or simply
	press <b>Ctrl+S</b>.)  If the file does not yet have a filename, Quarry
	will display the Save As dialog.  Enter the name for the
	file, then click OK.
      </p><p>
	If you want to save a game record under a different filename, chose
	File-&gt;Save As

	and click OK.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	  Currently, Quarry displays a warning when overwriting a game record file.  It is
	  temporary and will be removed when Quarry is more mature.  Meahwhile, you should
	  not overwrite files created with other SGF editors as there is a small chance
	  that some data will be lost.
	</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="register-game-playing-program"></a>To Register a Game-Playing Program</h3></div></div><p>
	To register a game-playing program in Quarry, first open the
	<a href="#preferences" title="Settings">Preferences dialog</a> and select
	GTP Engines category in its left pane.  (You can also click
	the Manage Engine List button in the
	<a href="#new-game-dialog" title="New Game Dialog">New Game dialog</a>, which immediatly displays
	the GTP Engines category.)
      </p><p>
	Then click the Add button and, in the appeared
	<a href="#preferences-gtp-engine-information-dialog" title="GTP Engine Information Dialog">dialog</a>, enter the
	command line required to launch the program in GTP mode.  You should consult the
	program's manual to find out how the command line should look like.  For instance,
	command line for
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html" target="_top">GNU Go</a>
	should look this way (note the double hyphens):
      </p><p>
	<b>gnugo --mode gtp --quiet</b>
      </p><p>
	Other programs may require different options or no options at all.

	The New Game dialog consists of two pages, Game &amp; Players
	and Game Rules.  When you open the dialog, the first page
	appears.  When you click Next button, the second page is
	displayed, which is specific for each of three games&#8212;Go, Amazons and
	Othello.
      </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="new-game-dialog-game-and-players"></a>Game &amp; Players Page</h4></div></div><p>
	  On this page you can select one of three available games and the opponents.  You
	  can make selections in arbitrary order&#8212;first choose the game and then the
	  opponents or the other way round.  At any time, all playable combinations of
	  games and computer players are marked with &#8220;Yes&#8221;
	  icons, while all unplayable combinations are marked with
	  &#8220;No&#8221; icons.  The Next
	  button is sensitive only when a playable combination of game and opponents is
	  selected.
	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	    Before playing against a computer program (i.e.
	    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html" target="_top">GNU Go</a>,
	    you need to register it in Quarry.  See
	    <a href="#preferences-gtp-engines" title="GTP Engines">GTP Engines</a> section for how to
	    do this.
	  </p></div><p>
	  Game &amp; Players page conists of the following controls:
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Game section</span></dt><dd><p>
		Here you can select the game you want to play, either Go, Amazons or
		Othello (also known as Reversi).  Note that most programs can play only
		one game.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">White Player and Black Player
	      sections</span></dt><dd><p>
		This set of controls determines the opponents.  Each opponent can be
		either a human or a computer program.  For a human player you can specify
		her name (defaults to your name as reported by the system.)  Computer
		opponent should be selected from the drop-down list.  If the list does not
		contain the program you want to play against, click the
		Manage Engine List at the end of the dialog to
		register the program in Quarry.
	      </p><p>
		Which player is to move first depends on the game.  In Go and Othello
		black moves first, while in Amazons white has the first turn.  You can
		always change sides with the Swap button to the
		right.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Swap button</span></dt><dd><p>
		This button allows you to easily swap players' sides.  It does nothing
		else but copying settings from White Player section
		to Black Player section and vice versa.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Manage Engine List button</span></dt><dd><p>
		This button opens Quarry Preferences dialog at the
		<a href="#preferences-gtp-engines" title="GTP Engines">GTP Engines</a> page.  A
		convenient way to register new program and/or modify parameters of the
		already registered ones just before starting a new game.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Next button</span></dt><dd><p>
		When you are done with this page, click the Next
		button to tweak game specific rules on the next page.
	      </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="new-game-dialog-game-rules"></a>Game Rules Page</h4></div></div><p>
	  On this page you can select the rules for the game.  The page has two parts.
	  The upper part is different for each of Go, Amazons and Othello games and
	  contains game-specific rules.  The lower part contains time limit settings
	  controls and is the same for all three games.  It is
	  <a href="#new-game-dialog-time-settings" title="Time Limit Settings">described</a> last.
	</p><p>
	  When you have selected the rules you want, click the Play
	  button to start the game.
	</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="new-game-dialog-go-rules"></a>Go Rules</h5></div></div><p>
	    Go has many different rule sets that differ in scoring details, treating of
	    some special positions etc.  Currently, Quarry doesn't make any difference
	    between them.  However, existing rule controls should be enough in most cases.
	  </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Board Size spin button</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Choose the size of board for the game here.  Go is traditionally played
		  on 19×19 board.  9×9 and 13×13 boards are also common.
		  Quarry doesn't limit you to these&#8212;choose any size between 5×5
		  and 25×25 inclusive.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Handicap controls</span></dt><dd><p>
		  When one of the players is weaker, it is common practice in Go to give
		  him <i>handicap</i> stones.  This gives her better
		  chances to win and makes the game more challenging (and thus more
		  interesting) for the stronger player.  The weaker player is
		  traditionally playing as black.
		</p><p>
		  Quarry supports both <i>fixed</i> (also known as
		  Japanese) and <i>free</i> (Chinese) handicaps.  In the
		  first case, handicap stones are placed following a traditional pattern,
		  at <i>hoshi</i> points.  Maximal fixed handicap is 9
		  stones.  With free handicap, on the other hand, black player actively
		  places the handicap stones at any intersections on the board.  Free
		  handicap is practically not limited.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		    Quarry treats free handicap as non-obligatory: it allows black to place
		    fewer handicap stones than specified in game rules (but not less than
		    two.)
		  </p></div><p>
		  If you want an &#8220;even&#8221; game, simply set the handicap to
		  zero.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Komi spin button</span></dt><dd><p>
		  <i>Komi</i> is the compensation to the white player for
		  playing second.  It is usually non-integer to make draws impossible.
		  The currently suggested komi for &#8220;even&#8221; game on 19×19
		  board is 6.5 points.  Smaller (or even negative) komi gives some
		  advantage to black player and can be used in addition to handicap.

	    Othello rules in Quarry are limited to board size and
	    <a href="#new-game-dialog-time-settings" title="Time Limit Settings">time limit settings</a>
	    described just below this section.  Standard board size for Othello is
	    8×8; 10×10 board is not uncommon too.  In Quarry you can select any
	    even board size from 6×6 to 24×24 inclusive.
	  </p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="new-game-dialog-time-settings"></a>Time Limit Settings</h5></div></div><p>
	    Quarry allows to play games with limited time for both players.  This also
	    applies to computer program players&#8212;they have to honor the alloted time
	    or lose.  Of course the programs are properly notified about the time limit
	    settings and the remaining time.
	  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	      Computer opponents use CPU time to generate moves.  This means that they
	      usually need less time on faster machines and more on slower machines.
	      Also, if you run a computationally intensive task while playing, your
	      computer opponents may become slower.  Finally, certain computer programs
	      may also
	      &#8220;think&#8221; on opponent's time.
	    </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	      At present, player who runs out of time doesn't lose automatically.  This
	      will be fixed before Quarry 0.2 is released.
	    </p></div><p>
	    Quarry has four types of time control:
	  </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">No limit</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Both opponents can take as much time as they like on each move, there
		  are no limits.  In this mode you can choose to select
		  &#8220;Keep track of total time&#8221; option.
		  Then Quarry will display the total time spent on move pondering by each
		  player.  This is purely for your information and serves no other
		  purpose.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Limited time for entire game</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Each player has limited time to play the whole game.  If a player fails
		  to finish the game in the alloted time, she loses.  Note that time limit
		  doesn't depend on the number of moves in the game.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Limited time per move</span></dt><dd><p>
		  Each move has to be played in fixed time.  Time not used is not stored
		  and not added to available time on next moves.  When using this mode,
		  keep in mind that in most games there are &#8220;difficult&#8221;
		  positions that require more pondering time.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Canadian overtime (also known as Canadian byo-yomi)</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This time control is often used in Go, but has nothing Go-specific, so
		  it can be used in any other move-based game.  Canadian overtime has the
		  advantage of imposing certain speed of play, but, at the same time,
		  allowing to occasionally spend more time on important moves.
		</p><p>
		  Canadian overtime has three parameters:
		  <i>main time</i>,
		  <i>overtime period length</i> and
		  <i>moves per overtime</i>.  Both players begin game in
		  their main time.  During main time they can play any number of moves at
		  any speed.  When main time for a player is up, first overtime period
		  begins.  During each overtime period a player has to play the specified
		  number of moves (<i>moves per overtime</i>.)  If she
		  fails to do so, she loses on time.  Otherwise, next overtime (of the
		  very same length) begins and the player has to play the same number of
		  moves this before the time is up again.  The number of overtimes is
		  unlimited and they are completely equal to each other: time not used in

	Board windows are the main part of Quarry.  They are used to play games and view
	and edit game records.  To the left in a window is the game board itself.  The
	exact appearance of the board depends on the current game (Go, Amazons or Othello)
	and can be <a href="#preferences-go-board-appearance" title="Go Board Appearance">configured</a>.  On
	the right side of the window there is information pane (to the top) and the
	comment window.

      To configure Quarry either click the Preferences button in the
      <a href="#when-start" title="When You Start Quarry">Control Center window</a> or choose
      Edit-&gt;Preferences
      menu item.
    </p><p>
      The Preferences dialog is displayed.  It consists of the following categories:

	At this page, all game-playing programs registered in Quarry are shown.  You can
	register new programs and modify information in existing entries.
      </p><p>
	All registered programs are shown in the list labeled
	List of GTP engines.  When you select one of them, some
	information about it is shown in the lower part of the dialog.  This inlcudes
	program name, version,
	supported game(s) and command line.  The
	command line is exactly what you specified while registering the program, while
	the rest of information is reported by the program itself.  All programs listed
	here are also shown in the <a href="#new-game-dialog" title="New Game Dialog">New Game dialog</a>
	as available computer opponents.
      </p><p>
	There are also five buttons on this page:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Add and Modify
	    buttons</span></dt><dd><p>
	      These two buttons allow you to register another program, or modify
	      information about an already registered one, correspondingly.  They both pop
	      up the
	      <a href="#preferences-gtp-engine-information-dialog" title="GTP Engine Information Dialog">GTP Engine
		Information dialog</a>.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Remove button</span></dt><dd><p>
	      This button removes a game-playing program from the list of registered
	      programs.  The unregistered program will not appear in the
	      <a href="#new-game-dialog" title="New Game Dialog">New Game dialog</a> as an available
	      opponent.  Of course, the program itself is not touched and you can
	      re-register it in Quarry later.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Move Up and Move Down
	    buttons</span></dt><dd><p>
	      Using these two buttons you can rearrange registered programs.  Computer
	      opponents in the New Game dialog are listed in exactly the same order as on
	      this page, so you may want to place more frequently used programs on the
	      top.  Another way to reorder GTP programs is to drag-and-drop their names in
	      the list.
	    </p></dd></dl></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="preferences-gtp-engine-information-dialog"></a>GTP Engine Information Dialog</h4></div></div><p>
	  This dialog is shown whenever you want to register a game-playing program in
	  Quarry or modify information about an already registered one.  Depending on the
	  situation, it can be titled either New GTP Engine or
	  Modify GTP Engine Information.  After you fill in the
	  dialog, press the Add or OK
	  button.  Quarry will launch the program to check if it works and ask it for some
	  information.
	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="preferences-gtp-engine-information-dialog-freeze"></a>Note</h3><p>
	    If the message
	    &#8220;Querying engine's name, version and known commands...&#8221; appears
	    and persists for too long (more than a few seconds), this most likely
	    indicates that the command line you specify starts the program in non-GTP mode
	    or starts a wrong program to begin with.  If you don't expect the program to
	    be very slow on initialization, then click the Cancel
	    button and fix the command line.
	  </p></div><p>
	  The dialog has two text entry fields:
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Command line</span></dt><dd><p>
		The command line to start the program should be entered here.  You can use
		the Browse button to select the program, but
		normally just specifying program filename is enough.  (More exactly, it is
		enough if the program is installed in a directory that is in your
		<tt>$PATH</tt> environment variable.)  In any case, you should enter
		program-specific options after its filename.  To find out which options
		should be used, see the manual of the program in question.
	      </p><p>
		For
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html" target="_top">GNU Go</a>,
		the command line should look like this (note the double hyphens):
	      </p><p>
		<b>gnugo --mode gtp --quiet</b>
	      </p><p>
		You may also want to specify additional options.  See GNU Go documentation
		for more information.
	      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Screen name</span></dt><dd><p>
		In this field you can specify the way Quarry will display the name of the
		program.  You can enter the full name or use special symbols
		&#8220;%n&#8221; and &#8220;%v&#8221;.  They will be replaced with the
		name and version of the program as it reports them itself.  In most cases
		the default value of &#8220;%n %v&#8221; is what you want, but sometimes
		it makes sense to alter it.  For instance, you can specify
		&#8220;%n %v level 5&#8221; here if you fixed program's level in the
		command line.  If, for some reason, you need the percent sign in the name,
		type it in as &#8220;%%&#8221; (the percent sign is used as
		<i>escape symbol</i> in this field.)

      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and
      useful document &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
      effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author
      and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.
    </p><p>
      This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that derivative works
      of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements the GNU
      General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </p><p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
      because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
      manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not
      limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of
      subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this
      License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section1"></a>1. APPLICABILITY AND
      DEFINITIONS</h4><p><a name="fdl-document"></a>
      This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
      of this License.  Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited
      in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
      &#8220;Document&#8221;, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of
      the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.  You accept the
      license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
      under copyright law.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-modified"></a>
      A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
      translated into another language.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-secondary"></a>
      A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
      the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
      authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters)
      and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus,
      if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
      explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
      philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-invariant"></a>
      The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
      the Document is released under this License.  If a section does not fit the above
      definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The
      Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any
      Invariant Sections then there are none.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-cover-texts"></a>
      The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
      as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document
      is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a
      Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-transparent"></a>
      A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
      represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that
      is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or
      (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
      available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
      A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
      markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
      is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
      amount of text.  A copy that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called
      &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
      markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
      available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
      human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
      Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
      are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
      produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-title-page"></a>
      The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
      such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
      requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which do not have any
      title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means the text near the most prominent
      appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-entitled"></a>
      A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document whose
      title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
      translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name
      mentioned below, such as &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
      &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or
      &#8220;History&#8221;.)  To &#8220;Preserve the Title&#8221; of such a section
      when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
      &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this definition.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-warranty"></a>
      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that
      this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to
      be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming
      warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void
      and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section2"></a>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h4><p>
      You may copy and distribute the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> in any
      medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
      Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions
      whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct
      or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
      However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a
      large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
      <a href="#fdl-section3">section 3</a>.
    </p><p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
      publicly display copies.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section3"></a>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h4><p>
      If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers)
      of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a>, numbering more than 100, and
      the Document's license notice requires
      <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</a>, you must enclose the copies in
      covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
      the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover
      must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
      visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with
      changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
      and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
    </p><p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should
      put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and
      continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
    </p><p>
      If you publish or distribute <a href="#fdl-transparent">Opaque</a> copies of
      the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      <a href="#fdl-transparent">Transparent</a> copy along with each Opaque copy,
      or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the
      general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network
      protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
      you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
      distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last
      time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
      that edition to the public.
    </p><p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well
      before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide
      you with an updated version of the Document.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section4"></a>4. MODIFICATIONS</h4><p>
      You may copy and distribute a <a href="#fdl-modified">Modified Version</a>
      of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> under the conditions of
      sections <a href="#fdl-section2">2</a> and
      <a href="#fdl-section3">3</a> above, provided that you release the Modified
      Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of
      the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
      to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><p>
	  Use in the <a href="#fdl-title-page">Title Page</a> (and on the
	  <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">covers</a>, if any) a title distinct from
	  that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
	  there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).  You may use
	  the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
	  gives permission.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
	  for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at
	  least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
	  authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this
	  requirement.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as
	  the publisher.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
	  copyright notices.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the
	  public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License,
	  in the form shown in the <a href="#fdl-addendum">Addendum</a> below.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
	  <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</a> and required Cover Texts
	  given in the Document's license notice.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Include an unaltered copy of this License.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve the section <a href="#fdl-entitled">Entitled</a>
	  &#8220;History&#8221;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at
	  least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as
	  given on the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;
	  in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
	  the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
	  Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access
	  to a <a href="#fdl-transparent">Transparent</a> copy of the Document,
	  and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
	  it was based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221; section.
	  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
	  years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it
	  refers to gives permission.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  For any section Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or
	  &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
	  the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
	  acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
	  in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of
	  the section titles.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Delete any section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.  Such a section may not
	  be included in the Modified Version.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;
	  or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
	</p></li><li><p>
	  Preserve any <a href="#fdl-warranty">Warranty Disclaimers</a>.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
      qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you
      may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
      this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
      license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </p><p>
      You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it contains
      nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties&#8212;for
      example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
      organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
    </p><p>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up
      to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the
      Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
      may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
      already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
      arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
      publisher that added the old one.
    </p><p>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
      permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of
      any Modified Version.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section5"></a>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h4><p>
      You may combine the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> with other
      documents released under this License, under the terms defined in
      <a href="#fdl-section4">section 4</a> above for
      <a href="#fdl-modified">modified versions</a>, provided that you include in
      the combination all of the <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</a>
      of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
      Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
      their <a href="#fdl-warranty">Warranty Disclaimers</a>.
    </p><p>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical
      Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there are multiple
      Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each
      such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
      original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
      Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in
      the license notice of the combined work.
    </p><p>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections
      <a href="#fdl-entitled">Entitled</a> &#8220;History&#8221; in the various
      original documents, forming one section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise
      combine any sections Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections
      Entitled &#8220;Dedications&#8221;.  You must delete all sections Entitled
      &#8220;Endorsements.&#8221;
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section6"></a>6. COLLECTIONS OF
      DOCUMENTS</h4><p>
      You may make a collection consisting of the
      <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> and other documents released under this
      License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents
      with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
      rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.
    </p><p>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
      individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the
      extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
      copying of that document.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section7"></a>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</h4><p>
      A compilation of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> or its derivatives
      with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
      the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the Document
      is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
      aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    </p><p>
      If the <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">Cover Text</a> requirement of
      <a href="#fdl-section3">section 3</a> is applicable to these copies of the
      Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the
      Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the
      aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
      form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section8"></a>8. TRANSLATION</h4><p>
      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations
      of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> under the terms of
      <a href="#fdl-section4">section 4</a>.  Replacing
      <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</a> with translations requires
      special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of
      some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
      Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and all the
      license notices in the Document, and any
      <a href="#fdl-warranty">Warranty Disclaimers</a>, provided that you also
      include the original English version of this License and the original versions of
      those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the translation
      and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original
      version will prevail.
    </p><p>
      If a section in the Document is <a href="#fdl-entitled">Entitled</a>
      &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or
      &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement
      (<a href="#fdl-section4">section 4</a>) to Preserve its Title
      (<a href="#fdl-section1">section 1</a>) will typically require changing the
      actual title.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section9"></a>9. TERMINATION</h4><p>
      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
      <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> except as expressly provided for under
      this License.  Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
      Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
      However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
      will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
      compliance.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-section10"></a>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</h4><p>
      The
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a>
      may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to
      time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
    </p><p>
      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
      <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> specifies that a particular numbered
      version of this License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have
      the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
      of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
      Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you
      may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
      Foundation.
    </p><h4><a name="fdl-addendum"></a>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for
      your documents</h4><p>
      To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in
      the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the
      title page:
    </p><a name="copyright-sample"></a><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME.
      </p><p>
	Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
	terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
	Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the license is included in
	the section entitled &#8220;GNU Free Documentation License&#8221;.
      </p></blockquote><p>
      If you have <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</a>,
      <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts</a>,
      replace the &#8220;with...Texts.&#8221; line with this:
    </p><a name="inv-cover-sample"></a><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
	being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      </p></blockquote><p>
      If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the
      three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
    </p><p>
      If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
      releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
      such as the
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU General Public
	License</a>,
      to permit their use in free software.
