Things that need to be done before releasing 0.2.


* Playing games

** Display move list?  Right column is already quite filled...

* Viewing game records

** Display remaining time as stored in game records.

** Display values of various SGF properties (`VA',  `BM' etc.)

** Game tree view

*** Make non-current branches a little ghostly.

*** Maybe add command to narrow to a subtree.

** Text search

*** Implement search history.

*** Maybe search other properties too?  `N' seems like a good
    candidate.

** Support multiple games in one files (postpone?)

* Editing game records

** Add a command to create a game record without starting a game.

** Add setup stones mode (add black/white stones or delete stones.)

** Add SGF markup editing mode.

** Add SGF labels editing mode.

** Add commands to delete node with children/children only.

** Add a command to score current position.

** Support editing various SGF properties (`VA', `BM' etc.)

** Add undo/redo commands.  Disable saving for unmodified files.

** Add command(s) to rearrange children of given node.

** Game information

*** Add a way to revert to original values.  Maybe a button to undo
    changes one by one (property by property.)

* Board Appearance

** Make Amazons queens look like chess queens (with SVG.)

* General GUI

** Do something about the Control Center, it is kinda ugly.
   (Oh, graphical artist, where art thou?)

** Support GTK+ 2.4 file chooser dialog.

** Think of what to add to the toolbars (help of anyone who uses
   toolbars is welcome.)

* SGF parsing

** Complete support for charsets.

** Handle file read errors gracefully.

* Internal board code

** Score sekis properly.

* Internal GTP code

** Issue `clear_board' command after `boardsize'.

* General

** Expand and fix manual.

** Browse all FIXMEs in the code and fix all that are bad.
