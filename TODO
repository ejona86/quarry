Things that need to be done before releasing 0.2.


* PLAYING GAMES

** Display move list?  Right column is already quite filled...

* VIEWING GAME RECORDS

** Display values of various SGF properties (`VA',  `BM' etc.)

** GAME TREE VIEW

*** Maybe add command to narrow to a subtree.

** TEXT SEARCH

*** Implement search history.

*** Maybe search other properties too?  `N' seems like a good
    candidate.

** Support multiple games in one file (postpone?)

* EDITING GAME RECORDS

** Add a command to create a game record without starting a game.

** Add setup stones mode (add black/white stones or delete stones.)

** Add SGF markup editing mode.

** Add SGF labels editing mode.

** Add commands to delete node with children/children only.

** Add a command to score current position.

** Support editing various SGF properties (`VA', `BM' etc.)

** Add undo/redo commands.

** Add command(s) to rearrange children of given node.

** GAME INFORMATION

*** Add a way to revert to original values.  Maybe a button to undo
    changes one by one (property by property.)

* BOARD APPEARANCE

** Make Amazons queens look like chess queens (with SVG.)

* GENERAL GUI

** Do something about the Control Center, it is kinda ugly.
   (Oh, graphical artist, where art thou?)

** Support GTK+ 2.4 file chooser dialog.

** Think of what to add to the toolbars (help of anyone who uses
   toolbars is welcome.)

* SGF PARSING

** Complete support for charsets.

** Handle file read errors gracefully.

* INTERNAL BOARD CODE

** Score sekis properly.

* INTERNAL GTP CODE

** Issue `clear_board' command after `boardsize'.

* GENERAL

** Expand and fix manual.

** Browse all FIXMEs in the code and fix all that are bad.



			HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE

When adding a specific to-do item, start it with a verb (``fix'',
``implement'', ``add'' etc.)  When adding a placement (for instance, a
name of a module) for to-do items, make it a noun or a phrase that
acts as a noun and uppercase the entire line to make it stand out.

When something has been implemented, delete or update the appropriate
entry here, don't mark it with ``done'' or something similar.  This
file is only meant to track unimplemented, but planned features.
Those that have been implemented should be mentioned in NEWS (and in
ChangeLog.)
