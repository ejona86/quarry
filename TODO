	   THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE RELEASING 0.2

* PLAYING GAMES

** Display move list?  Right column is already quite filled...

* VIEWING GAME RECORDS

** Display values of various SGF properties (`VA',  `BM' etc.)

** GAME TREE VIEW

*** Maybe add command to narrow to a subtree.

** TEXT SEARCH

*** Implement search history.

* EDITING GAME RECORDS

** Support editing various SGF properties (`VA', `BM' etc.)

** Add command(s) to rearrange children of given node.

** Add a way to change the player to move.

** GAME INFORMATION

*** Add a way to revert to original values.  Maybe a button to undo
    changes one by one (property by property.)

* BOARD APPEARANCE

** Make Amazons queens look like chess queens (with SVG.)

* GENERAL GUI

** Do something about the Control Center, it is kinda ugly.
   (Oh, graphical artist, where art thou?)

* SGF PARSING

** Complete support for charsets.

** Handle file read errors gracefully.

* INTERNAL BOARD CODE

** Score sekis properly.

* INTERNAL GTP CODE

** Issue `clear_board' command after `boardsize'.

** Be nicer to engines, don't crash if they don't support some command.

* GENERAL

** Expand and fix the manual.

** Browse all FIXMEs in the code and fix all that are bad.



			THINGS PLANNED FOR 0.4

* INTERNET GAME SERVER(S) SUPPORT

** Start with IGS, since KGS has proprietary protocol and NNGS/old IGS
   isn't really used anymore.

* VIEWING GAME RECORDS

** Support multiple games in one file, same for editing.

* GTP SUPPORT

** Add some sort of GTP console for generic GTP engine access.  Look
   at GoGui for an example.

* GENERAL

** Drop support for GTK+ 2.0 and 2.2 at least.  Remove all related
   code.

** Make functions receive `size_t' and `gsize' where appropriate, e.g.
   as string lengths.  Be extra careful with passing through `...'.



			HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE

When adding a specific to-do item, start it with a verb (``fix'',
``implement'', ``add'' etc.)  When adding a placement (for instance, a
name of a module) for to-do items, make it a noun or a phrase that
acts as a noun and uppercase the entire line to make it stand out.

When something has been implemented, delete or update the appropriate
entry here, don't mark it with ``done'' or something similar.  This
file is only meant to track unimplemented, but planned features.
Those that have been implemented should be mentioned in NEWS (and in
ChangeLog.)
